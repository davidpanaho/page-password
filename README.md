# Page Password plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

A simple plugin that allows you to password protect a page. It's design is based on an answer I found on [StackExchange](https://craftcms.stackexchange.com/questions/8360/protect-a-page-with-a-single-password).

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-beta.23 or later.
